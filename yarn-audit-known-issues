If the URL starts with protocol-relative URL (`//`), it is incorrectly treated as a same-origin request, and the XSRF token is automatically added to the `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header.\n\n### Impact\nThe token leakage completely bypasses Angular's built-in CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to capture the user's valid XSRF token. Once the token is obtained, the attacker can perform arbitrary Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against the victim user's session.\n\n### Attack Preconditions\n1. The victim's Angular application must have **XSRF protection enabled**.  \n2. The attacker must be able to make the application send a state-changing HTTP request (e.g., `POST`) to a **protocol-relative URL**  (e.g., `//attacker.com`) that they control.\n\n### Patches\n- 19.2.16\n- 20.3.14\n- 21.0.1\n\n### Workarounds\nDevelopers should avoid using protocol-relative URLs (URLs starting with `//`) in HttpClient requests. All backend communication URLs should be hardcoded as relative paths (starting with a single `/`) or fully qualified, trusted absolute URLs.","reported_by":null,"title":"Angular is Vulnerable to XSRF Token Leakage via Protocol-Relative URLs in Angular HTTP Client","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-66035"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"@angular/common","vulnerable_versions":">=20.0.0-next.0 <20.3.14","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-58c5-g7wp-6w37","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 20.3.14 or later","patched_versions":">=20.3.14","updated":"2025-11-26T23:18:51.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-201","CWE-359"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-58c5-g7wp-6w37"}}}
